# HealifyAI - LLM based Healthcare System
Leverages Extensive power of Machine Learning (ML) &amp; NLP LLM to provide in-depth answers to medical queries and can predict diseases based on patient symptoms

Description: This project aims to develop a comprehensive healthcare system that leverages the power of Machine Learning (ML) and LLM to predict diseases based on patient symptoms and provide accurate answers to medical queries.

The system consists of two main modules:

Disease Prediction Model: This component uses traditional ML algorithm to predict potential diseases based on the symptoms input by the user. The model is trained on a large dataset of hundreds to thousands of patient records (denoted by frequency in dataset) to ensure reliable predictions. Covering a total of 135 categories of common and as well as rare yet important health conditions, diseases, psychology disorders such as diabetes, dehydration, depression, bipolar disorder, HIV, breast cancer, stroke, pneumonia, flu, asthma, obesity and so on.

QA Language Model: This component uses a Language Model (LLM) to answer medical queries from users. The LLM is trained on my from-scratch scraped & cleaned corpus dataset of medical queries & professional solutions, enabling it to provide detailed and accurate answers to a wide range of medical questions. Sample addition was done to enhance the dataset queries. Covering urgent topics of diagnosis, treatment, causes, risks, complications, details of symptoms, disease description.

The combination of these two components allows for a robust and interactive healthcare system that can assist both patients and healthcare professionals in diagnosing diseases and finding relevant medical information. The system is designed to be user-friendly, with an intuitive interface that makes it easy for anyone to use.

Please note that while this system can provide valuable insights and information, it is not intended to replace professional medical advice. Always consult with a healthcare professional for medical concerns.
